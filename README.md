During development, make sure that you are on your firstname-lastname branch. When doing a pull request, use `development` as the target branch.

*At the start of each day, run the following:* 
- `git pull origin development`
- `npm install` (this will ensure any dependencies that were installed by others are updated for you)
- `npm start`

Make sure to post what you're working on to Slack 

*When you've completed a feature, or arrived at a good milestone* 
- Send pull request to the `development` branch; add team as reviewers
- Post what you worked on to Slack 

Periodically and at the end of the project, we will merge the `development` branch into `master`.
